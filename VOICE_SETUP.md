# Voice Chat Setup Guide

I've implemented a much more reliable voice chat solution that replaces the problematic browser Speech Recognition API with a **MediaRecorder + Web Audio API** approach.

## What's Changed

### ✅ **New Implementation Benefits:**
- **No more network errors** - Uses MediaRecorder API which is much more stable
- **Real-time audio level visualization** - Shows recording levels as you speak
- **Better error handling** - Clear feedback when issues occur
- **Cross-browser compatibility** - Works in all modern browsers
- **Professional recording quality** - Uses optimized audio settings

### ❌ **Old Implementation Problems:**
- Browser Speech Recognition API was unreliable
- Constant network errors and infinite retry loops
- Limited browser support and inconsistent behavior

## How It Works Now

1. **Click the microphone button** to start recording
2. **Speak your message** - you'll see audio levels in real-time
3. **Click the microphone again** to stop recording
4. **Audio is sent to backend** for transcription
5. **Transcribed text appears** in the input field
6. **Send the message** or edit it before sending

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install multer
```

### 2. Choose a Speech-to-Text Service

You have several excellent options:

#### Option A: OpenAI Whisper API (Recommended)
- **Pros:** Excellent accuracy, supports many languages, easy to use
- **Cost:** $0.006 per minute
- **Setup:** Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file

```bash
# In backend/.env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Then uncomment the Whisper implementation in `backend/src/index.js` and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install form-data node-fetch
```

#### Option B: AssemblyAI (Great Alternative)
- **Pros:** High accuracy, free tier (416 hours), developer-friendly
- **Cost:** Free tier, then $0.37/hour
- **Setup:** Sign up at [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/)

#### Option C: Google Speech-to-Text
- **Pros:** Good accuracy, 60 minutes free
- **Setup:** Requires Google Cloud setup

#### Option D: Keep Placeholder (For Testing)
- The current implementation returns placeholder text
- Good for testing the UI without setting up transcription

### 3. Update CORS Settings (If Needed)

Make sure your frontend URL matches the CORS setting in `backend/src/index.js`:

```javascript
app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://localhost:8080', credentials: true }));
```

Change `http://localhost:8080` to match your frontend development server URL.

### 4. Start the Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd ..
npm run dev
```

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes (`VoiceAssistant.tsx`)
- Replaced Speech Recognition API with MediaRecorder API
- Added real-time audio level visualization
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Better state management for recording

### Backend Changes (`backend/src/index.js`)
- Added `/api/transcribe` endpoint for audio processing
- Multer middleware for file uploads
- Placeholder implementation with examples for real services

### CSS Updates (`ChatAssistant.css`)
- Added audio level indicator styles
- Recording state animations
- Better visual feedback

## Recommended Speech-to-Text Services

### 1. **OpenAI Whisper** (Best Overall)
```javascript
// Already implemented in backend - just uncomment and add API key
const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}` },
  body: formData,
});
```

### 2. **AssemblyAI** (Best Free Tier)
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'authorization': process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY },
  body: audioBuffer,
});
```

### 3. **Web Speech API** (Client-side, but limited)
```javascript
// Can be used as fallback for simple cases
const recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
recognition.continuous = false;
recognition.interimResults = false;
```

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Start both servers** (frontend and backend)
2. **Open the voice assistant page**
3. **Click the microphone button** - should turn red and show "Recording..."
4. **Speak something** - you should see audio levels
5. **Click microphone again** - recording stops and processes
6. **Check the input field** - should show transcribed text (or placeholder)

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Permission Issues
- Browser will prompt for microphone access
- Make sure to allow the permission
- Check browser settings if issues persist

### CORS Errors
- Ensure backend CORS origin matches your frontend URL
- Check that both servers are running

### Audio Not Recording
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify microphone is working in other applications
- Try refreshing the page

## Future Enhancements

- **Voice Activity Detection:** Auto-start/stop recording based on speech
- **Multiple Language Support:** Configure transcription language
- **Audio Compression:** Reduce file sizes before upload
- **Offline Transcription:** Use local Whisper models
- **Real-time Streaming:** Stream audio for faster transcription

This new implementation is much more reliable and provides a professional voice chat experience!
